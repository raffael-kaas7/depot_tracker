"""
Base Bank API Interface for Depot Tracker.

This module defines the abstract base class for all bank API implementations.
It provides a common interface and shared functionality for different banking
APIs (like Comdirect, ING, etc.) while allowing each implementation to handle
their specific authentication and data retrieval procedures.

The base class handles:
- Common file I/O operations for storing API responses
- Data sanitization and type conversion
- Consistent folder structure for different depot data
- Abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete bank APIs
