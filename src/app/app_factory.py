"""
Application Factory for Depot Tracker.

This module implements the application factory pattern for creating and configuring
Dash applications. The factory pattern allows for flexible application creation
with different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.

The factory handles:
- Dash app instantiation with Bootstrap CSS theming
- Configuration loading and application
- Callback registration for interactive components
- Layout setup for the main dashboard interface
- Background scheduler initialization for data updates
