"""
Background Scheduler Service for Depot Tracker.

This module implements a background task scheduler using APScheduler that handles
automated data updates and snapshot creation for the depot tracking application.
The scheduler runs background jobs that:

1. Update current prices from Yahoo Finance for both depots
2. Create daily snapshots of depot values for historical tracking

The scheduler uses the registry pattern to access shared service instances and
implements proper lifecycle management to ensure clean shutdown when the 
application stops.
